		<h1>TAP: A Smart Dish Sponge</h1>

<!-- 		<p>Project manager on a team of 5 students from Olin College, Babson College, and Massachusetts College of Art. We were told to design and develop a ‘sustainable product for the home.’ The final presentation included a functional proof-of-concept, a visual model, and a hypothetical business plan.</p>
		<p> Through our user research, we realized many people still wash their dishes by hand in a sink. Almost 90% reported that they leave the faucet running during this task, wasting 1,000s of gallons of clean water per year.</p>
		<p>We saw an opportunity to reduce this waste by evolving a commonon household item: the dish sponge.</p>
		<p>TAP is a smart dishwashing sponge that enables the user to control their sink with a simple tap of the sponge. A small wireless transmitter inside the sponge controls a solenoid valve attached to the end of the sink faucet. The attachment simply screws onto the faucet with no under-sink plumbing required. The transmitter is removable so that sponges can be replaced when dirty.</p>
		<p>The concept of evaluating an idea based on technical feasibility, user desirability, and financial viability was not new to me, but this project pushed my ability to find a satisfactory solution to all three.</p> -->
