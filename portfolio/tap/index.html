	<h4>Context</h4>
	<p><em>ENGR 3250: Integrated Product Design (IPD), a co-taught course between Olin College, Babson College, and Massachusetss College of Art.</em></p>
	<p>IPD was a one semester opportunity for students to identify an opportunity for a product to reduce enviornmental waste in the home, validate and prototype the product, and ultimately produce a "proof-of-concept" pitch to a group of academics and professionals.</p>
	<h4>Role / Teammates / Time</h4>
	<p>Product Manager / 4 / 4 months (09/2013 - 12/2013)</p>
	<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
	<p><ul>
		<li>Oversee project logistics regarding meeting schedules, deliverables, presentations, etc.</li>
		<li>Create of project timeline and process; focus on integrating engineering, business, and design processes</li>
		<li>Coordinate and facilitate user interviews</li>
		<li>Construct and test engineering prototypes</li>
	</ul></p>
	
	<h4>Problem Identification</h4>
	<p>Handwashing dishes is a common task in global households. In observing how people handwash their dishes, we noticed the majority leave their sink faucet running for the duration of the activity. "It's a 3-armed job: one to hold the plate, one to hold a sponge, and another to control the water. Guess which one loses out?"</p>
	<p>Several products already exist for hands-free faucet controls: infrared 'automatic faucets' and foot pedal controls are the most common. These products have various drawbacks: 
		<ul>
			<li>expensive: many of those who have the most to gain from this product have limited purchasing power</li>
			<li>complicated to install: many potential customers lack the experience or property rights to make significant changes to their kitchen</li>
			<li>erratic and unreliable: we want to empower our users, not get in their way</li>
		</ul></p>
