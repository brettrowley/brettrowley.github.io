	<h4>Context</h4>
	<p><em>ENGR 2330: Introduction to Mechanical Prototyping (MechProto)</em></p>
	<p>MechProto gives students an introduction to basic fabrication and design techniques for engineering prototypes. Over one semester, teams built three separate robots using three different methods: subtractive machining, sheetmetal, and 3D printing. A stock electronics control package and other basic components (wheels, steering arms, etc.) were also provided. Each robot had the same task: extinguish a raging campfire as quickly as possible. A $50 budget was provided to each team for the purchasing of unqiue parts or materials.</p>
