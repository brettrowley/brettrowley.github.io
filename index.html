	<div class="about">
		<p>I'm a full stack designer passionate about all phases of product development. I've always wanted to build things; from LEGO, to race cars, to medical devices, to web apps. My background is a unique blend of engineering, project management, and human factors. As a generalist I'm always working to improve my skills; currently I'm focused on visual design and stakeholder collaboration.</p>
		<p>I've always worked at start-ups and love getting to wear multiple hats. Start-ups also give me the chance to advocate for the user throughout the organization, not just Product . I was honored when a colleague once described me as "the best pain in the butt at this company."</p>
		<p>Outside of work I like to run, play attacking midfielder in soccer, explore as many coffee shops as I can find, buy books faster than I can read them, and dream of race cars.</p>
