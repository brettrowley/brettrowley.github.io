	<h2 id="about">About</h2>
	<p>Olin College of Engineering gave me not only a solid grounding in engineering, but also significant experience in user-centered design by building real products for real people. Add some business courses plus free-lance graphic design into the mix and you're probably getting the picture.</p>
	<p>My education helped grow my passion for creating products with a superior user experience, tempered with a big-picture perspective on technical and business constraints. I consider myself an "in-betweener" who works best in interdisciplinary teams and loves to guide projects from a whiteboard sketch to a public product.</p>
