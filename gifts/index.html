	  	<li><strong>Camera lens</strong><br>My current lens (17-85mm) has a broken autofocus and I'd like to replace it with a similar size, but better build quality.</li>
	  	<li><strong>Nicer headphones</strong><br>My Klipsch S4 are great, but I would like some over-the-ear headphones for work. Past experience with over-the-ear has been poor because of interference with my glasses.</li>
	  	<li><strong>Replace my laptop</strong><br>My Sony Vaio is 6 years old and is starting to feel its age in places. It's had a good life and I think it might be time to retire it for a newer computer (desktop?).</li>
	  	<li><strong>Nice scotch</strong><br>Because I don't know why I don't already have some in my pantry.</li>
